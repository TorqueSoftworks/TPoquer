------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rundown:

TPoquer is what we call a network "poking" tool, named as such because it "pokes" the URL / IP that you present it with for information.

This info includes but is not limited to:
- Country
- Registration Date
- City
- Organization Identification Tag
- NetType
- NetName
- CIDR
- HTTP Headers
- Open Ports

Note: TPoquer is NOT a "hacking" tool in any way shape or form, all of the information it provides are availible to the public in one way or another.





-----------------INSTALLATION-------------------------

If you are on Debian, or another Debian based distro such as Ubuntu, Zorin and Pop_OS! you should go to the github repository and navigate to the "releases" section, in there you will find a file called "TPoquer_X.X.X.deb", download that file and install it with the following:

cd /<insert_you_package_location>
sudo dpkg -i TPoquer_X.X.X.deb


If you are on on RedHat Enterprise, or another RedHat based distro such as Fedora, CentOS and Rocky Linux, you should go to the github repository and navigate to the "releases" section, in there you will find a file called "TPoquer_X.X.X.rpm", download that file and install it with the following:

cd /<insert_you_package_location>
sudo rpm -ivh TPoquer_X.X.X.rpm

------------BUILDING FROM SOURCE---------------------

As you may have noticed, TPoquer is not natively availible for the Arch Linux family of distros as such it is recommended that you either simply run the Poquer.lua file using the command:

cd /<insert_your_lua_file_directory>
lua Poquer.lua -flags

However, if you want to be able to run the tool from anywhere in your terminal you will need to have one of several available lua compilation tools such as:

- luatastic
- luapak (requires luarocks)
- srlua

which can then be used to manually integrate the binary into your system

Alternatively, you may use a package converter tool (such as DebTap) to convert either the Debian package or the RedHat package into a usable Arch package.


----------------ACTUALLY USING TPOQUER--------------------------

To use TPoquer you can run the command "poque <url/ip> -parameter".
For example:

poque domain.com -clip

poque 192.0.2.1 -wtf /directory/file.txt

after this you will wait a second, then the output will be displayed on your terminal


But wait a minute, what do those flags do?

-------------FLAGS / PARAMETER EXPLANATIONS---------------

the -wtf flag stand for "write to file" ;) and must be succeeded by a directory that leads to a file example: poque domain.com -wtf /path/to/file.txt <-- this will write the poked info to the file

the -clip flag is fairly self explanitory and simple, it cant be succeeded by anything and copies all the poked information to the users clipboard.

------------------------------------------------------------

alright, that everything, happy poqueing!
